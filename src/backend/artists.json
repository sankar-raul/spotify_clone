        "description": "Over the last decade, DJ Snake has achieved the kind of rarefied and wildly transformative success that few artists ever come close to attaining. Originally from a housing project on the outskirts of Paris, the multi-platinum-selling DJ/producer has shattered industry records with smash hits such as “Taki Taki,” earned diamond certification from the RIAA for \"Lean On\" (with Major Lazer), delivered era-defining bangers like “Turn Down for What” (with Lil Jon), and made history as the first artist to perform atop the roof of the Arc de Triomphe. Along with repeatedly turning out tracks that top the charts around the world—including three songs that have surpassed a staggering billion streams on Spotify—the multi-award-winning phenom brings his boundary-pushing ingenuity to music that builds unexpected and undeniably powerful bridges between vastly different cultures and genres. (“I grew up with people from different origins such as India, West Indies to Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East,” he told Rolling Stone in recent years. “We’ve always been inspired by each other.”) Taking his stage name from his former moniker as a graffiti artist, he started DJ-ing in his early teens and soon dropped out of high school to work at a famed Paris record shop, then immersed himself in music production at the age of 19 to become a decade later one of the most important electronic music artist in the world."

        "description": "Singer, actress, dancer, producer, and businesswoman, Jennifer Lopez parlayed her Golden Globe-nominated portrayal of tragic Latin pop icon Selena in the 1997 biopic into pop culture superstardom, including forging a career as an influential pop star in her own right. Establishing a confident, sensual style, her first single, 1999's \"If You Had My Love,\" went all the way to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Just two years later, Lopez became the first woman to hit number one on the album chart and at the box office in the same week, with her second album, J.Lo, and her lead role opposite Matthew McConaughey in The Wedding Planner. While continuing to land occasional lead roles on the silver screen, she became a fixture in the Top Ten with albums including the Spanish-language Como Ama una Mujer (2007) and her seventh full-length, Love? (2011). Lopez issued another Top Ten studio album, A.K.A., in 2014 before leaving American Idol in 2016 to star in the NBC crime drama Shades of Blue (2016-2018). February 16, 2024 celebrated the release of This Is Me…Now, Lopez’s first studio album in nearly a decade, celebrates the anniversary of its sister album, This is Me…Then. The album, written and executive produced by Lopez and Rogét Chayed, along with Angel Lopez, Jeff \"Gitty\" Gitelman, HitBoy, Tay Keith and INK among others, effortlessly blends R&B, contemporary pop sounds and hip-hop beats, combined with her emotional signature vocals is Lopez’s most honest and personal yet."

        "description": "With inventive re-imaginings of the reggae-splashed, hook-heavy soul popularized by acts like Sean Paul and Sean Kingston in the early half of the 21st century's first decade, Virgin Islands-born singer Iyaz (born Keidran Jones) swiftly built up a hearty cult following on MySpace. Kingston, in the process of forming his own Time Is Money label, stumbled upon Iyaz's site and snapped up the 21-year-old singer as the maiden signee of his new imprint. Iyaz's debut single, \"Replay,\" an iPod name-checking musical stew that added splashes of classical and electronica to his usual island pop, soared to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 2009. The song, written by Iyaz and R.City, topped the U.K., Australian, and Swiss pop charts and eventually went platinum -- several times over -- in the U.S. Follow-up single \"Solo\"  it reached number three in the U.K. followed boy third single \"So Big\"-- but it set up the June 2010 release of Replay. After extensive touring and a change of labels, Iyaz released Aurora only in Japan."
